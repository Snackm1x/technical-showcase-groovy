To use the photo album id and title retriever:

1. Make sure you have groovy installed. Go here for details: (http://groovy-lang.org/install.html)
2. Point your terminal/command line to the folder containing "photo_album.groovy" and enter "groovy photo_album"
    to start the program.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts. Enter "photo-album" or "photo-id" followed by an id to retrieve a list of associated
    photo IDs and titles. Enter "q" into the prompt to quit.
4. To run the unit test file, enter "groovy photo_album_test" into the command.

Thank you for your time.
